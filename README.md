## Quick Practice Challenge

Ready to test what youâ€™ve learned? Try this on your own â€” without copying the earlier steps.  
You can always refer back if you get stuck. ðŸ’¡

### The Challenge

Imagine youâ€™re organizing your personal projects.

Try to create the following structure:

```
my_projects/
â”œâ”€â”€ website_redesign/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ notes.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ mobile_app/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tasks.txt
```

### What You Should Try:

*   Go to your home directory  
    
*   Create a folder called `my_projects`  
    
*   Inside it, create two folders: `website_redesign` and `mobile_app`  
    
*   In `website_redesign`, create a file called `notes.txt` and write one line of text  
    _Hint: You can use `echo "Homepage layout ideas" > notes.txt`_  
    
*   In `mobile_app`, create a file called `tasks.txt` and add a short note  
    _Hint: Use `echo "Start login screen design" > tasks.txt`_  
    
*   Rename `notes.txt` to `design_notes.txt`  
    
*   Copy `design_notes.txt` into `mobile_app/`  
    
*   Delete the original `design_notes.txt` from `website_redesign`  
    
*   Use `ls` to confirm your changes, and also check your work using File Explorer

Take your time, and donâ€™t worry if you make a mistake â€” thatâ€™s part of learning!

You now know how to work with files and folders â€” including navigating, organizing, and managing them â€” just like a developer.
